# Coinspace

> *Decentralizing education through NFT ownership and crypto royalties*

Coinspace is a Web3-powered educational platform where every learning module is minted as an NFT on the *Sui blockchain*. Our vision is to reshape how education is created, distributed, and monetized — making it decentralized, transparent, and creator-owned.

---

## 🌍 Vision
We believe education should be:
- *Accessible to everyone*
- *Owned by creators*
- *Incentivized through crypto*

Through Coinspace, educational content becomes a crypto asset. Authors get royalties, learners get access, and everyone shares the value.

## 💡 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📘 NFT-Based Modules | Every course/module is minted as an NFT. Can be free (gas only) or paid (direct crypto to creator). |
| 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Royalty | Revenue goes *directly* to the content creator. No middlemen. |
| 🔐 Ownership Proof | Learners have on-chain proof of what they’ve learned via their NFT collection. |
| 🧠 Creator DAO (Coming Soon) | Creators can vote on platform features and fee structures. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| 🧱 Blockchain | [Sui Network](https://sui.io/) (for minting NFTs, storing ownership, and handling royalties) |
| 🪄 Smart Contract | Written in *Move*, deployed to Sui Mainnet |
| 🖼 Asset Storage | [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) (for decentralized module storage) |
| 🌐 Frontend | Vite + React + TypeScript |
| 🦊 Wallet Integration | Suiet / Sui Wallet SDK |

## 🚨 Problems We're Tackling

1. *No creator control over educational platforms*
   > Big edtech platforms own the content. Coinspace gives it back to creators.

2. *Lack of incentives for learners and educators*
   > Coinspace rewards contribution and participation using crypto and NFTs.

3. *Censorship and centralization*
   > Everything is on-chain. No one can remove or gatekeep knowledge.

4. *Proof of learning is still Web2*
   > Coinspace NFTs = digital diplomas with real blockchain provenance.

---

## 🧬 How It Works

1. *Creator uploads a learning module* (PDF, video, etc.)
2. The content is uploaded to *Arweave* (permanent storage)
3. Metadata + link to module is passed into a *Sui Move smart contract*
4. Learners mint the NFT (free or paid)
5. Creators receive crypto royalties directly into their wallet
6. Learners collect NFTs as *proof of completion*
